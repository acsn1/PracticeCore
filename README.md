## Practice Core
This is a sample practice core I started making in **10/16/2022** for educational/github purposes.

## 🔧 Programming Language & Tools
Java was used to compile this minecraft plugin using IntelliJ IDE.

## 📌 Sample
The meaning of "sample" is that, only the structural code is provided in Github and I will not go in-depth providing solutions or making a fully working practice core which you can compile and download. The purpose of this repository, is to showcase my coding style and assist possibly others when they are making their own practice core.
